          <h4 id="list-item-3"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-right"> HoD's Message</i></h4>
          <p>It gives me immense pleasure to pen down my greetings for all the students and parents on behalf of Department of Computer Science and Engineering, M.I.E.T, Meerut. The Department of Computer Science & Engineering was established in M.I.E.T in 1997. Since then the department equips its students with undergraduate (B.Tech) and postgraduate (M.Tech) level expertise and appropriate skills in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.

            The department considers the committed and dedicated staff as its core strength in providing value education with professional standards. Our faculties with experiences in both teaching and industry constantly aspire to achieve academic excellence with emphasis on ingraining inventive thinking and leadership skills in our students. Varieties of workshops are held over entire session to enable knowledge impartment and improving programming skills in C, Python, Android, Oracle JAVA, .Net, Cloud Computing, Big Data and Internet of Things. It is a known fact that Computer Software and Service Industry are dynamic and ever-changing.
            
            Itâ€™s phenomenal growth offers great opportunities for economic growth and development. The Industry Oriented Programs of the department are highly innovative and keenly sought after. Programs include Amazon Web Services, SAP, Salesforce, Adobe Web Analytics, IBM-Blockchain, Security Intelligence and Big Data etc, for the students to bridge the gap between academics and I.T industry. One of the biggest strength of our department is to inseminate strong entrepreneurial culture among our students.
            
            With assiduous hard work of Department and support of our Institution, many of our students benefit from the on-campus Business Incubation Center and others able to bag jobs in top companies like Tata Consultancy Services, IBM, Wipro Technologies, BOSCH, Grapecity, GenPact, HITACHI, SmartPixs and many more. I am confident that our department will keep on with its legacy to harness its students with the necessary ambience to adorn their knowledge and skills to achieve their long term goals and take our Institute to greater heights.</p>
